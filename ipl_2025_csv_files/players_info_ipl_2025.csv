He emerged from a cricketing backwater, the eastern Indian state of Jharkhand, and made it to the top with a home-made batting and wicketkeeping technique, and a style of captaincy that scaled the highs and hit the lows of both conservatism and unorthodoxy."
Shivam Dube,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383700/383773.1.png",Chennai Super Kings,Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Allrounder,"A tall pace-bowling allrounder from the suburbs of Mumbai who started in the city's robust school cricket circuit, Shivam Dube shot to limelight in domestic cricket and the IPL with his almost unparallel six-hitting ability, especially against spin."
Khaleel Ahmed,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/322200/322268.1.png",Chennai Super Kings,Right hand Bat,Left arm Fast medium,Bowler,"A left-arm medium pacer and opening bowler for India Under-19s, Khaleel Ahmed has been a dependable performer at the youth level. He came into the Under-19 World Cup in 2016 with 12 wickets in three innings, including 3 for 29 against Sri Lanka in the final of the Tri-Nation Under-19s tournament in Colombo. He couldn't quite extend that wicket-taking form into the World Cup, but was a regular presence in the side."
Deepak Hooda,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/345000/345083.1.png",Chennai Super Kings,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder,"An allrounder who can bat in any position, Deepak Hooda also bowls offbreaks, offers plenty of athleticism as a boundary fielder, and is an asset in any T20 side. His big hitting as a 19-year-old in his debut IPL season, in 2015, earned with the nickname ""Hurricane Hooda"", but more importantly, got him a Rs 4.2 crore (US$ 622,000 approx) contract with Sunrisers Hyderabad at the next auction."
Matheesha Pathirana,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/355400/355402.1.png",Chennai Super Kings,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Plucked out of the T10 league, Matheesha Pathirana made his IPL debut for CSK in 2022, when he dismissed Shubman Gill and Hardik Pandya"
Ayush Mhatre,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/390300/390331.2.png",Chennai Super Kings,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batting Allrounder,"Ayush Mhatre is yet another teen batting sensation from Mumbai. He took to the game when he was five, but it was at 15 that he transitioned to thinking about professional cricket."
Ravindra Jadeja,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316600/316600.2.png",Chennai Super Kings,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Allrounder,"Dissed when he first appeared, Ravindra Jadeja won the doubters and haters over with his deeds, and now sits among the elite of Indian spin bowling."
Sam Curran,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383100/383153.1.png",Chennai Super Kings,Left hand Bat,Left arm Medium fast,Allrounder,"Sam Curran, younger brother of Tom Curran, his fellow Surrey all-rounder, and son of the former Zimbabwe cricketer Kevin Curran, fulfilled his destiny at the age of 19 years and 363 days, when he made his Test debut against Pakistan at Headingley in June 2018. One Test later, he scooped his maiden Man-of-the-Match award, after four first-innings wickets and a thrilling counter-attacking half-century had given England the edge in a gripping Edgbaston Test against India. His success merely heightened the debate as to whether batting or bowling will ultimately become his strongest suit."
Noor Ahmad,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383200/383239.1.png",Chennai Super Kings,Right hand Bat,Left arm Wrist spin,Bowler,"Following in the footsteps of his countrymen, Rashid Khan and Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Noor Ahmad is another spinner from Afghanistan who is popular on the franchise T20 league circuit. His rare skillset - left-arm wristspin - led to opportunities across the globe even as a teenager."
Vijay Shankar,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/322600/322613.1.png",Chennai Super Kings,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Allrounder,"A middle-order batter who can grind attacks and bowl medium-pace, Vijay Shankar established himself as one of the key members of a Tamil Nadu side undergoing transition in 2014-15. Particularly strong off the pads, and with a fondness for driving on the up, Shankar made scores of 111, 82, 91, 103 in the Ranji Trophy knockouts to finish with 577 runs at 57.70 that season, after returning from a groin injury."
Rachin Ravindra,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383100/383182.1.png",Chennai Super Kings,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Batting Allrounder,"A dynamic batter, who can slot in at the top as well as in the middle order, and bowl left-arm fingerspin, Rachin Ravindra was earmarked to become a future batting leader for New Zealand right from his Under-19 days."
Ravichandran Ashwin,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/393300/393315.2.png",Chennai Super Kings,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Bowling Allrounder,"R Ashwin took the tricks and skills he learned playing tennis-ball cricket on the streets of Chennai, particularly the soduku ball, a finger-flicked legbreak, to Test cricket, where he became perhaps the leading offspinner of the first quarter of the 21st century."
Rahul Tripathi,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/356800/356821.5.png",Chennai Super Kings,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Top order Batter,"A technically correct middle-order batter, Rahul Tripathi came to the game in the footsteps of his father, an army man who in his time turned out for Uttar Pradesh in junior cricket and also played at university level."
Devon Conway,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383100/383148.1.png",Chennai Super Kings,Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Wicketkeeper Batter,"Eight years into his professional career, Devon Conway scored his maiden first-class double hundred for Gauteng in a three-day match in South Africa in 2017. Four years later he'd score another double, but this time for New Zealand on his Test debut, becoming only the second - but also the oldest - player to do so in the side, where he quickly established himself as an attacking but composed top-order batter with the ability to shift gears quickly to adapt to match situations."
Jamie Overton,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/324200/324243.1.png",Chennai Super Kings,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowling Allrounder,"It did not take long for Jamie Overton to attract the attention of England's selectors. Blessed with unusual pace and height (he is 6ft 5ins), Overton was called into the England squad for the ODI series against Australia at the end of 2013 aged just 19 and with only 13 List A games behind him."
Mukesh Choudhary,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/398600/398614.5.png",Chennai Super Kings,Left hand Bat,Left arm Medium,Bowler,"After having spent time as a net bowler at CSK, he made his IPL debut for CSK in 2022"

The previous season the franchise had taken a punt on Gaikwad as one for the future, slotting him in as an anchoring opener who could attack when needed. They gave him six games and he showed what he was capable of, with over 200 runs."
Urvil Patel,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/391800/391896.2.png",Chennai Super Kings,Right hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,

He burst onto the scene in domestic cricket as a 17-year-old scoring half-centuries on both his first-class and List A debuts for Victoria in November 2019. He was part of Australia's Under-19 World Cup team in South Africa 2020 but had to return home mid-tournament after being scratched by a monkey at a nature reserve on a day off.
Sameer Rizvi,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/397400/397425.4.png",Delhi Capitals,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batter,Sameer Rizvi turned heads in the auction before IPL 2024 where he was picked for an eye-popping INR 8.40 crore (USD 1 million dollars approx) by Chennai Super Kings (CSK).

The change wasn't smooth - Kuldeep admitted that he had even tried once - but he soon realised bowling left-arm wristspin was the way forward for him. And he was good at it too, having not only solid control over the length, but also a potent wrong'un among his variations."
Axar Patel ,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/331100/331164.2.png",Delhi Capitals,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Allrounder,"Left-arm spinner Axar Patel has been increasingly handy with the bat in the lower order across formats - enough to be classified as a bowling allrounder. He played just one first-class game in his debut season for Gujarat, but had a more successful showing in 2013, when he was one of the key contributors to India Under-23s' title win in the ACC Emerging Teams Cup, with seven wickets, including a four-for in the semi-final against UAE. He was consistent for Gujarat with bat and ball in the Ranji Trophy that season, finishing with 369 runs at an average of 46.12 and 29 wickets at 23.58."
Mohit Sharma,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316700/316702.2.png",Delhi Capitals,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Bowler,"Although Mohit Sharma burst onto the domestic scene during Haryana's best Ranji Trophy season in 2011-12, he made his own headlines a year later. In his debut season Mohit had played just three matches when Haryana made an impressive run to the semi-finals, but during the 2012-13 Ranji season he emerged as one of the best fast bowlers in the country, finishing as the fifth-highest wicket-taker. Despite that, not many had seen or known about the youngster from Faridabad, who had been on the fringes ever since he rose through age-group cricket camps organised by the Haryana Cricket Association."
Abishek Porel ,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/393400/393462.2.png",Delhi Capitals,Left hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,"A beneficiary of the Impact Player rule, Porel might not have started the IPL 2024 season, but with Delhi Capitals in need of momentum in their IPL 2024 opener, they sent him in at 138 for 7 and he smashed 32 off just 10 balls."
Mukesh Kumar,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/373900/373907.1.png",Delhi Capitals,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Bowler,"With his all-format international debut in the Caribbean in 2023, Mukesh Kumar was among the bowlers next in line after the likes of Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami. He is also among the rare breed of bowlers who got his maiden India call-up before playing a single IPL game."
Vipraj Nigam,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/397400/397429.4.png",Delhi Capitals,Right hand Bat,Legbreak,Bowler,"Vipraj Nigam is a 20-year-old legspinning allrounder from Uttar Pradesh, who impressed in the UPT20 league. That got him a UP debut in all formats. Playing for Lucknow Falcons, he picked 20 wickets in 11 innings at a strike rate of 11.15 and an economy of 7.45. Nigam has played three first-class, five List-A and seven T20 matches in the 2024-25 season for UP. While he is predominantly a legspinner, and a good one at that, don't discount his late-order hitting."
Mitchell Starc,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/390900/390978.5.png",Delhi Capitals,Left hand Bat,Left arm Fast,Bowler,"First there was Johnson, then there was Starc. A left-armer called Mitchell has been a staple of Australia's attack for more than a decade and Starc will go down as one of the country's finest all-format bowlers."
Tristan Stubbs,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/348500/348577.1.png",Delhi Capitals,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batter,"A batter seemingly born for the modern game, Tristan Stubbs is known for his fearless approach to batting. But there is more to him than just big-hitting. Stubbs also takes an energetic approach to longer-formats, and within four years of making his first-class debut, averaged over 50 in it."
Faf du Plessis,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316500/316559.1.png",Delhi Capitals,Right hand Bat,Legbreak,Middle order Batter,"Classy, composed and a fine crafter of innings, Faf du Plessis emerged as one of South Africa's most consistent batsmen in the post-Jacques Kallis era. Du Plessis is strong on the front foot, has impeccable defences and enjoys spending time at the crease. A natural leader, du Plessis was put in charge of the T20 side in February 2013 and formed part of the senior core in other formats."
KL Rahul ,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/319900/319942.3.png",Delhi Capitals,Right hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,"A tall, elegant right-hand batter who can keep wicket in a crisis, KL Rahul is among the most highly rated opening batters in India's next generation. Rahul was a part of India's squad in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup and made his first-class debut later that year. Having taken a while to establish himself as a first-class cricketer, he enjoyed a breakthrough 2013-14 season, laying the foundation for Karnataka's Ranji Trophy victory with 1033 runs, which included three centuries, three nineties, and a Man-of-the-Match performance in the final."
Karun Nair,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/399200/399231.5.png",Delhi Capitals,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Top order Batter,"The year 2016 was memorable for Karun Nair. He made his ODI debut against Zimbabwe in July, his selection a reward for his consistency in domestic cricket - he had averaged more than 50 in his first three seasons. In October, he was elevated to captain of his state side, Karnataka. In November, he was given his first Test cap in the Mohali Test against England. In his third Test, he became India's second triple-centurion after Virender Sehwag, and only the third man in the game's history to convert a maiden Test ton into a triple."
Dushmantha Chameera,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/319800/319862.2.png",Delhi Capitals,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Tall, slim and slippery, Dushmantha Chameera arrived at NCC in 2012, and was quickly marked out as a bowler for the future. First among his virtues is pace, generated from a slightly round-arm action that sacrifices movement. Capable of consistently hitting speeds of over 140 kph, coaches believe he had become the quickest bowler in the country by 23. He had played only a handful of games in his first two seasons, but came into his own in NCC's 2013-14 championship run, claiming 32 first-class cricket at 21.18."
T Natarajan,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/322600/322699.1.png",Delhi Capitals,Left hand Bat,Left arm Medium,Bowler,"At the IPL 2017 auction, T Natarajan turned heads when he went from a base price of INR 10 lakh to a winning bid of INR 3 crore from Punjab Kings (PBKS). That made him the highest-paid uncapped Indian player at the time."
Mustafizur Rahman,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/319700/319734.3.png",Delhi Capitals,Left hand Bat,Left arm Fast medium,Bowler,"Mustafizur Rahman is a left-arm pace bowler who came to Dhaka to try out for a fast-bowling camp in 2012, after he had impressed in an Under-17 tournament in Satkhira, some 300km from Dhaka. He got admitted to the BCB's pace foundation and soon caught the coaches' attention to make the Bangladesh Under-19 side for the 2014 World Cup."

His extraordinarily effective legspin has made him one of the greatest T20 bowlers ever, among the first names on wishlists of teams in leagues all around the world."
Jos Buttler ,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383100/383143.1.png",Gujarat Titans,Right hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,"England have had many players down the ages who have gained world acclaim, but Jos Buttler is arguably their first global T20 superstar. He helped bring their limited-overs batting into the 21st century, and his impact on the one-day and T20 sides was extraordinary as they turned a group-stage exit in the 2015 World Cup into a triumph on home soil four years later."
Sai Sudharsan,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/390600/390648.2.png",Gujarat Titans,Left hand Bat,Legbreak,Top order Batter,"A tall left-hand batter, Sai Sudharsan is a post-Covid era emerging star from Tamil Nadu.

Washington Sundar,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/322600/322619.1.png",Gujarat Titans,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Bowling Allrounder,"Like R Ashwin from Tamil Nadu before him, Washington Sundar went from being a batsman as a youngster to making his name as an offspinner. After representing India at the 2016 Under-19 World Cup, he replaced Ashwin at Rising Pune Supergiant in the 2017 IPL, and bowled at an impressive economy rate to help his side to the final."
Mohammed Siraj,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/322600/322611.1.png",Gujarat Titans,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Mohammed Siraj's rise as a seamer was remarkably swift. The son of an autorickshaw driver in Hyderabad, he only began playing the game in class seven. It was in 2015 that he first bowled with a cricket ball. In 2017, he bagged an IPL contract worth INR 2.6 crore. Months later, he was wearing an India shirt and bowling in a T20 international against New Zealand."
Shubman Gill ,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/398500/398534.2.png",Gujarat Titans,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Opening Batter,"A right-hand top-order batsman from Punjab, Shubman Gill is known for his penchant for big runs and was hence drafted into India Under-19 side as the vice-captain for the 2018 World Cup.

He always had accuracy, and when he increased his pace, he became even more effective. On his ODI debut against England in Pune in 2021, he picked up 4 for 54, the best figures by a debutant for India at the time. He was on the path to becoming India's enforcer in the middle overs, but a spate of injuries thwarted his career."
Ishant Sharma,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316600/316602.3.png",Gujarat Titans,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,"With a physique reminiscent of a young Javagal Srinath, tall and wiry Ishant Sharma shot into prominence during the 2007-08 Test series in Australia, where he moved the ball both ways at pace and delivered a searching spell to Ricky Ponting in Perth that became the stuff of cricket lore."

That hundred - the 176 against Australia at Pallekele - was a match-flipping, series-defining knock, which given the fact no other batsman mustered more than 55 in the game, is one of the greatest ever Sri Lankan innings.

Jacks became the first England debutant spinner since 1993 to claim a five-for on Test debut in 2022, setting up a famous win in Rawalpindi. Not only was it his maiden first-class five-for, he was not even meant to be in the side: he was a late change to the side before the toss with Ben Foakes ruled out through illness."

That followed consecutive 400-plus run seasons for Scorchers in the BBL - where his adaptability at moving from the top order to the middle was noted by selectors - and having continued to flay runs in county cricket for Leicestershire he was named in Australia's 2021 T20 World Cup despite not being part of any of the previous series."

Sandeep, who began as a batsman for his school in Patiala before his coach persuaded him to take up bowling seriously, was part of India's Under-19 squad for the 2010 World Cup in New Zealand. He came into his own in the same event two years later, in Australia, where he took four wickets in the final, against the hosts, and finished as the joint-highest wicket-taker for India (12). As a result, Sandeep was signed by Kings XI Punjab ahead of the 2013 season. In three seasons for his franchise, Sandeep not only took 39 wickets, but was regularly employed by his captain George Bailey to bowl the death overs. Sandeep was soon drafted into India's T20 side for the two-match series against Zimbabwe in 2015, where he failed to deliver. In 2014, however, Sandeep suffered a stress fracture of the back that kept him out of competitive cricket for five months. He returned strongly to claim 28 scalps in the 2014-15 Ranji Trophy, the most for his side."

At 6ft 3in, left-hander Padikkal, primarily an opener, is able to use his height and reach to meet good-length balls on the rise. He took his first-season form into the 2020-21 Vijay Hazare Trophy, in which he became the first Indian batter to score four consecutive List A hundreds. He made over 400 runs in the 2021 IPL as well, and it led to an India call-up, in Sri Lanka. But just when Padikkal's career was taking off, an acute intestinal issue struck him, affecting his form and fitness for two years. After two middling seasons with Rajasthan Royals, where he shuttled up and down the order, he was traded to Lucknow Super Giants ahead of the 2024 IPL. He found his feet again just before that, becoming Karnataka's top run-getter in the 2023-24 Vijay Hazare Trophy and following it up with four hundreds in six first-class games."

Understandably, his potential has impressed coaches. In the age of T20, a bowler who can spin it away from both right and left-handers, not to mention employ different lines of attack to the same batsman, could potentially have team owners and data analysts drooling, so long as Kamindu continues to develop those skills."
